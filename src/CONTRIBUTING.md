# Contributing to the Para-C Compiler

Due to active and early development not available. (Can be expected with later
versions, such as v0.1 or v0.2) - Reason for that is the there is not a lot
that can be contributed to, since changes are made while the theory is made
as well. This means contributions are going to be limited until the basic
structure is finished.
