The Extension Tasks in Para-C are a simple way to integrate programs or scripts
into your program, which do not have to be compiled executables (but can be).

These are designed to allow for code- and program integration into your Para-C
program in a function-style calling manner, where results and data of the
extension task can be utilised in the Para-C program without creating your own
handling.

.. note::

    For each language handling can vary due to the possible restrictions each
    language can provide.

.. warning::

    This entire section and its functionality are at the moment only existent
    in theory. There are no current existing usable examples! This also means
    the syntax or functionality can change!
