- `Compilation Context <./compilation_ctx.html>`_ - Compilation Context used to store the information about Para-C files, programs and its contents.
- `Logic Tokens and Streams <./logic_tokens_and_stream.html>`_ - Logic Tokens and Streams used to represent and store a Para-C file and its logical content
- `Error Handler <./error_handler.html>`_ - Error Handler which is used with the Antlr4 Listener to recognise Syntax Errors and other problems inside the user-files.
