Para-C Pre-Processor, which handles the Para-C directives and alters the code
before it is then sent to the main `Compiler <../compiler/index.html>`_

Reference Overview
==================

- `Compilation Context <./compilation_ctx.html>`_ - Compilation Context used to store the information about Para-C files, programs and its contents. (Pre-Processor specific)
- `Logic Tokens and Streams <./logic_tokens_and_stream.html>`_ - Logic Tokens and Streams used to represent and store a Para-C file and its logical content
- `Error Handler <./error_handler.html>`_ - Error Handler which is used with the Antlr4 Listener to recognise Syntax Errors and other problems inside the user-files.
- `Listener <./listener.html>`_ - Listener, which goes through the Antlr4 generated tree and generates the Token Streams
- `Antlr4 Parser <./parser.html>`_ - Antlr4 Parser, which lexers and parses the files (auto-generated by the grammar file)
