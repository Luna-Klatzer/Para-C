This is the folder containing the c-implementation library (Para-C Core Library, 
and partly Para-C Built-In Library), which is used for the built-in functions, 
keywords and items, which are required for the base language.

For the Para-C Extension Library, go [to the lib folder](https://github.com/Para-C/Para-C/tree/dev/lib)
