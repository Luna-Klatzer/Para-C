# Para-C

*Para-C is not intended to be a widely „optimised“ or „production-ready“ programming language. It is solely a free-time
project designed for learning and testing purposes, which we do not intend for anything other than that.*

Para-C is a new programming language designed to integrate C directly and make it possible to use Para-C as a helper 
to write better C-Code. Including adding more features, like built-ins, OOP-structures, more straightforward array and
malloc-handling, expanded data types and better structures for more significant projects. Still, unlike others to make 
an entirely new language with new syntax, systems and logic, it is built around to have just a simpler syntax and 
structure similar to Python and TypeScript but can include directly code from C and use its speed in the compiled 
execution. It will use mangling and higher-level features (mid-level) while providing almost the same interface as C. 
So, programming in Para-C will be similar, but still in its way simple and well looking. Syntax-wise it will still lay
onto C to avoid causing issues or additional checking for more unique styles of writing code, so despite the different 
look, the declaration and writing style will have a similar feel to C.
