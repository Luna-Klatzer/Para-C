# Para-C

*Para-C is not intended to be a widely „optimised“ or „production-ready“ programming language. It is solely a free-time
project designed for learning and testing purposes, which we do not intend for anything other than that.*

## Summary

Para-C is a new programming language designed to integrate C directly and make it possible to use Para-C as a helper 
to write better C-Code. Including adding more features, like new built-in Macros and functions, OOP-structures, 
more straightforward array and malloc-handling, expanded data types and simplified functions. 

Still, unlike others to make an entirely new language with new syntax, systems and logic, it is built around to have
just a simpler syntax and structure similar to Python and TypeScript but can include directly code from C and use its 
speed in the compiled execution. 

It will serve as a helper but also extension to C and provide features and easier implementations to achieve more in 
less time. So, programming in Para-C will be similar, but still in its way simpler and well looking. Syntax-wise it 
will still lay onto C to avoid causing issues and additional compiler-code. Despite the partly different look and 
functions, the writing style will have a similar feel to C.
